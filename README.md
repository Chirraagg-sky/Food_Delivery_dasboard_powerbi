Food Delivery Company Sales Analytics using PowerBI

Problem Statement
Your task is to create a Power BI report for a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. The report should help the fulfilment centres with demand forecasting for the upcoming weeks. The report should be based on three datasets: historical demand data for each product-center combination, product features such as category, sub-category, price, and discount, and information about the fulfilment centres such as location and city.

The report should answer the following questions posed by the sales director:

1. Total number of orders with a date filter
2. Revenue earned by the company
3. Total discounted value and overall discount %
4. Whether the business follows the Pareto principle
5. Top 5 selling categories
6. Influence of operational area on number of orders
7. Effectiveness of email and product features as a mode of promotion
8. Forecasted weekly quantity sold for each centre, city, and meal category for the next 5 weeks.
The report should be granular enough to include product information and center-meal combinations. The report should be visually appealing and interactive to allow the sales director to easily understand the level of demand for each centre and make informed decisions.

Approach
Crafted interactive dashboard on 450k+ rows dataset across 15 fields using Power Query and DAX

Outcome
Outcome Answered business related question like Total Sales, Total Orders, Forecasting, Pareto Analysis etc.
